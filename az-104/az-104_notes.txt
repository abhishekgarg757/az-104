.net core in linux and windows , asp.net in windows only , Ruby 2.6 is only  Linux only
CNAME record is required to map www.cloudportalweb.com to prodwebapp1.azurewebsites.net.
When mapping a custom domain to an Azure Web App, you typically use a CNAME record to point to the default domain provided by Azure for the app
You can turn on Web Server Logging. This will give a detail of all of the web server requests being made to the Azure Web App
You scale up by changing the pricing tier of the App Service plan that your app belongs to.
 Scale out: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app.

If you create a DNS zone in Azure, then you need to first make a note of the Name servers for the DNS zone. Then go to your DNS provider and enter the Name servers for your Domain.
azure dns zone : Manage and host your registered domain and associated records.

Add a custom domain to your Azure
Create a CNAME DNS record.
Associate the custom domain with your CDN endpoint.
Verify the custom domain.

new-AzDNSrecordSet
Azure DNS private zone allows private name resolution between Azure Virtual Networks.

You have to modify the Name server records in the external domain registrar to reflect the Name server records provided in the Azure DNS zone

a. An "A" record maps a domain name to the IP address (IPv4) of the computer hosting the domain. It uses the domain name to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet. In this case, we want mail.example.com to point directly to an IP address of your mail server.

b. A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is a type of DNS record that maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name. CNAME records are typically used to map a subdomain such as www or mail to the domain hosting that subdomain’s content.

c. The MX (Mail Exchange) record is crucial for directing email to your domain, but it doesn't directly map to an IP address like the A or AAAA records. Instead, it points to a domain name (usually a subdomain like "mail.example.com").

d. In Azure DNS, you can create a TXT record for various purposes. For example, you might need to create a TXT record to verify that you own the domain you want to add to Microsoft 365. Or, you might need to create a TXT record to validate a custom domain for your app service.

Cloud Device Administrator
PRIVILEGED
This is a privileged role. Users in this role can enable, disable, and delete devices in Microsoft Entra ID and read Windows 10 BitLocker keys. The role does not grant permissions to manage any other properties on the device. this role allow  to add   regisrterd/joined devices to any group

User administrator – can create and manage users and groups, and can reset passwords for users, Helpdesk administrators and User administrators.
User Access Administrator – No access to the resource except the ability to change the access control.
Adding a group to an administrative unit brings the group itself into the management scope of the administrative unit, but not the members of the group
You can have Administrative Units and assign the administrators privilege over each unit. You can have one unit for each office.
You just need to specify the user principal name for each user in the list when submitted for the Bulk delete operation.

We can enable encryption on a running IaaS virtual machine in Azure.

AZure Disk encryption:
ADE is integrated with Azure Key Vault.
ADE encrypted VM can be backed up to the Recovery Service Vault.
ADE uses DM-Crypt for Linux-based VMs.
ADE uses BitLocker for Windows VM-controlled disks.

A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service.

Each resource or resource group can indeed have a maximum of 50 tag name/value pairs.

before you can delete a recovery services vault,  you need to stop the backup and delete the backup data. , 
you cant delete a recovery services vault, having registered storage accounts.,protected data sources (f, IaaS VMs, SQL databases, or Azure file shares).
we can have one backup policy for the Azure virtual machines and one for Azure file shares. The Azure SQL Databases have a separate backup mechanism via automated backups

Azure Policy, you can assign it at the Tenant Root Group level.
You need to start adding exclusions from the Management Group onwards
The maximum level you can go till when it comes to assigning the Azure Policy is the Resource Group level.: means cannot assign it to virtual machine/resource level
you can add exclusions at the resource level

policy exection sequuence : disable,modify,deny,audit
Azure Policy definitions have modes like 'Indexed' and 'All'. There isn't a mode called 'DoNotAllow'.

In Entra ID, licenses can be assigned both to individual users and to groups. Licenses are not automatically provisioned for every user upon creation. Users can also have multiple licenses.
License cannot be assigned to a user without a usage location specified.

bicep:
1.Azure CLI can be used to directly convert ARM template JSON files to Bicep files.

b. Bicep files can be deployed to Azure without first converting them to ARM templates, as Azure CLI and PowerShell can handle the transpilation for you.

c. A Bicep file can also be translated to its equivalent ARM template, allowing users to see what the ARM JSON representation would look like.

d. Validate a Bicep file using Azure PowerShell without deploying it. Use the what-if operation to verify that the Bicep file makes the changes that you expect.

arm to bicep : bicep decomplie "template.json"
bicep to arm : bicep build"template.bicep"

Service endpoints allow you to restrict access to Azure PaaS services to specific VNets, making them suitable for securing Azure SQL Database access from a VNet.

Monitoring
Topology view : shows you the resources in your virtual network and the relationships between them.
Connection monitor  : allows you to monitor connectivity and latency between endpoints inside and outside Azure.,continous , average route time

Network diagnostic tools:
IP flow verify :allows you to detect traffic filtering issues at a virtual machine level.,verify the flow of traffic
ip flow : capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound) If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication.
IP flow  verify : checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and a remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned.


NSG diagnostics allows you to detect traffic filtering issues at a virtual machine, virtual machine scale set, or application gateway level.
Next hop helps you verify traffic routes and detect routing issues.

Connection troubleshoot enables a one-time connectivity and latency check between a virtual machine and Bastion host, application gateway, or another virtual machine.

Packet capture enables you to capture your virtual machine traffic.

VPN troubleshoot runs multiple diagnostics checks on your VPN gateways and connections to help debug issues.

Traffic
NSG flow logs and VNet flow logs (preview) : allow you to log network traffic passing through your network security groups (NSGs) and virtual networks respectively.

Traffic analytics: processes your NSG flow log data enabling you to visualize, query, analyze, and understand your network traffic.

connection troubleshoot : from one vm to another at a particular time

Network Performance Monitor: latency between your on-premises network and the virtual machines.

To record the successful and failed connection requests, we should use Azure Network Watcher flow logs. First, we can enable Network Watcher in the region of our choice and then use the Azure Network Watcher flow logs.The flow logs are then written to a storage account
