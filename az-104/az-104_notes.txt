SAS tokens are typically used for blobs, queues, and tables, and stored access policies are specifically for controlling the start time, expiry time, and permissions for SAS tokens.

for administrator , password reset policy is differnet : The two-gate policy requires two pieces of authentication data, such as an email address, authenticator app, or a phone number, and it prohibits security questions. Office and mobile voice calls are also prohibited for trial or free versions of Microsoft Entra ID.

low priority vms , standard load balancer and scale setcannot be moved to other regions , 

Microsoft Entra authentication allows users to connect to Azure using their Microsoft Entra credentials. Native Microsoft Entra authentication is only supported for OpenVPN protocol and also requires the use of the Azure VPN Client. The supported client operation systems are Windows 10 or later and macOS.

User administrator – can create and manage users and groups, and can reset passwords for users, Helpdesk administrators and User administrators.
User Access Administrator – No access to the resource except the ability to change the access control.

We can enable encryption on a running IaaS virtual machine in Azure.

A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service.

Each resource or resource group can indeed have a maximum of 50 tag name/value pairs.

before you can delete a recovery services vault,  you need to stop the backup and delete the backup data. , 
you cant delete a recovery services vault, having registered storage accounts.,protected data sources (f, IaaS VMs, SQL databases, or Azure file shares).
we can have one policy for the Azure virtual machines and one for Azure file shares. The Azure SQL Databases have a separate backup mechanism via automated backups
policy exection sequuence : disable,modify,deny,audit
Azure Policy definitions have modes like 'Indexed' and 'All'. There isn't a mode called 'DoNotAllow'.

Gatewaytransit is a peering property that lets one virtual network use the VPN gateway in the peered virtual network for cross-premises or VNet-to-VNet connectivity

Uniform Mode: In uniform mode, all VM instances in the VMSS are identical, using the same image and configuration. Since our requirement is to add custom virtual machines to VMSS, we need to choose orchestration mode as Flexi,

Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) replaces the Log Analytics agent (also known as MMA and OMS)

default frequency of collecting platform metrics : 1 minute

Azure Monitor Log Analytics allows you to query and analyze detailed records from various sources, making it suitable for analyzing system updates across VMs.

In complete mode, the Resource Manager deletes resources in the resource group that aren't specified in the template.


The Azure Backup vault was an older construct and has been superseded by the Recovery Services vault.

In Entra ID, licenses can be assigned both to individual users and to groups. Licenses are not automatically provisioned for every user upon creation. Users can also have multiple licenses.
License cannot be assigned to a user without a usage location specified.

Azure Files provides the capability to take snapshots of SMB file shares. Share snapshots capture the share state at that point in time.

bicep:
1.Azure CLI can be used to directly convert ARM template JSON files to Bicep files.

b. Bicep files can be deployed to Azure without first converting them to ARM templates, as Azure CLI and PowerShell can handle the transpilation for you.

c. A Bicep file can also be translated to its equivalent ARM template, allowing users to see what the ARM JSON representation would look like.

d. Validate a Bicep file using Azure PowerShell without deploying it. Use the what-if operation to verify that the Bicep file makes the changes that you expect.

arm to bicep : bicep decomplie "template.json"
bicep to arm : bicep build"template.bicep"
vmsize : 'Standard_DS1_v2 '

When mapping a custom domain to an Azure Web App, you typically use a CNAME record to point to the default domain provided by Azure for the app

Once you add a cloud endpoint to a Sync group, you can’t add any other shares as the cloud endpoint.
Once you add a server as a server endpoint with a particular file path, you can’t add the server as another endpoint with another path.

you can’t enable Multi-Factor authentication for external users. There is no dependency as such on the phone numbers. : can be added in latest
Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration allows organizations to work with external users by inviting them to their Microsoft Entra tenant

the replication type of the storage account can be changed to Zone redundant storage only if the current replication technique is either LRS or GRS.

Fault domains are used to define the group of virtual machines that share a common source and network switch. You can have up to 3 fault domains.
Update domains are used to group virtual machines and physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time. You can have up to 20 update domains.
27 vms on 5 updaet domains: 27/5 = 5 it means 2 updaet domains have 6 and 3 update domins have 5 vms each

Service endpoints allow you to restrict access to Azure PaaS services to specific VNets, making them suitable for securing Azure SQL Database access from a VNet.

a. An "A" record maps a domain name to the IP address (IPv4) of the computer hosting the domain. It uses the domain name to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet. In this case, we want mail.example.com to point directly to an IP address of your mail server.

b. A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is a type of DNS record that maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name. CNAME records are typically used to map a subdomain such as www or mail to the domain hosting that subdomain’s content.

c. The MX (Mail Exchange) record is crucial for directing email to your domain, but it doesn't directly map to an IP address like the A or AAAA records. Instead, it points to a domain name (usually a subdomain like "mail.example.com").

d. In Azure DNS, you can create a TXT record for various purposes. For example, you might need to create a TXT record to verify that you own the domain you want to add to Microsoft 365. Or, you might need to create a TXT record to validate a custom domain for your app service.
